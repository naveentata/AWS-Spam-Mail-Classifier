# AWS Spam Mail Classifier Using AWS Services

Implemented a machine learning model to predict whether a message is spam or not. Furthermore, I used SES to create a custom domain for receiving mails, a system that, upon receipt of an email message, automatically flags it as spam or not based on the prediction obtained from the machine learning model using AWS services.
